# Legal Text Summarization with Transformers

This project focuses on automatic summarization of legal documents using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically leveraging transformer-based models. The goal is to generate concise and informative summaries from lengthy legal texts, aiding in quick comprehension and analysis.

## Project Overview

In the legal domain, professionals often deal with vast amounts of text data, including contracts, judgments, and legal briefs. Manually summarizing these documents is time-consuming and prone to human error. This project provides an automated solution for generating extractive or abstractive summaries of legal texts, aiming to improve efficiency and accessibility of information.

The project demonstrates the pipeline for training (or fine-tuning) and deploying a state-of-the-art summarization model.

## Features

- **Legal Text Processing**: Handles and tokenizes raw legal text data.
- **Transformer-based Summarization**: Utilizes powerful transformer models for generating summaries.
- **Dataset Preparation**: Efficiently processes and prepares large datasets for model training/inference.
- **Model Persistence**: Saves the trained model for future use and deployment.
- **Performance Tracking**: Includes mechanisms (implied by progress bars and output files) for monitoring dataset processing.

## Model Architecture

This project employs a transformer-based architecture for text summarization. While the exact model (e.g., BART, T5, Pegasus) is not explicitly stated in the provided snippets, the presence of `config.json`, `generation_config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, `vocab.json`, and `merges.txt` strongly indicates the use of a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face Transformers library. These models are highly effective for sequence-to-sequence tasks like summarization due to their attention mechanisms and ability to capture long-range dependencies in text.

## Dataset

The project processes legal text data. While the specific dataset name is not provided, the file `pile-of-law.py` suggests a connection to a legal corpus or a custom script for handling legal documents. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for robust model development and evaluation.

## Tools and Libraries

The project is built using Python and leverages the following key libraries:

- **pandas**: (Likely used for) Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Fundamental package for numerical computing.
- **transformers (Hugging Face)**: Core library for working with pre-trained transformer models and tokenizers.
- **os**: For operating system interactions, such as file path management.
- **shutil**: For high-level file operations, including archiving models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: The development environment, utilizing Jupyter widgets for interactive progress displays.

## Installation

To set up and run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/legal-text-summarization.git
   cd legal-text-summarization
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required libraries:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy transformers
   ```
   *(Note: Additional dependencies might be needed depending on the specific transformer model used, which transformers usually handles automatically.)*

## Usage

1. **Prepare your legal text data:**
   Ensure your legal documents are in a format that can be processed by the notebook. The notebook likely expects a specific input structure (e.g., a CSV file, a directory of text files). If `pile-of-law.py` is a data loading script, ensure it's configured correctly.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   Open the `NLU_project.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment (e.g., Jupyter Lab, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code with Python extension) and execute all cells. This will download necessary model components, process the data, and perform summarization.

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   Then, navigate to and open `NLU_project.ipynb`.

3. **Review Summaries:**
   The generated summaries and comparison results will be saved to `summary_comparison.json` in the `/content/` directory (or a specified output path).

## Results

The project aims to produce high-quality summaries of legal texts. The `summary_comparison.json` file will contain the generated summaries, which can be analyzed for coherence, conciseness, and accuracy against original texts or reference summaries.

## Model Export

The trained summarization model is exported as a zip archive (`legal_summarizer_model.zip`). This allows for easy sharing and deployment of the model in other applications or environments without needing to retrain it.
